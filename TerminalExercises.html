    Part II
    1. What does the man command do? -- "provides command Manual for whatever cmand you pass through" 
    2. Type in man rm. How do you scroll and get out? --- "you press enter to scroll and "q" to exit"
    3. Look at the man page for ls. What does the -l flag do? --- "use a long listing format" What does the -a flag do? --- "shows all files in directory, including hidden files"
    5. How do you jump between words in the terminal? --- "ALT left/right arrows or Alt and the "F" key as well as Alt "B" Key"
    6. How do you get to the end of a line in terminal? --- "press ctrl and the "e" key"

    8. How do you delete a word (without pressing backspace multiple times) in terminal?
    9. What is the difference between a terminal and shell? --- "The terminal is where you tell the comands that produce an output; the shell is actually interpreting those comands and executing the interpretation to the terminal"
    10. What is an absolute path? --- "shows a full path from the root directory, all pathsto get to your current location"
    11. What is an relative path? --- "shows the path starting at your current location"
    12. What is a flag? --- "adds a specification or expand the ability of the original commnd" Give three examples of flags you have used.--- "ls -a: shows all files vs just 'ls'; cp -r: allows to copy a full directory; mv -i "will prompt before overide"  " "
    13. What do the r and f flags do with the rm command? --- " f" is a force remove without a prompt, while -r will remove full directories"
